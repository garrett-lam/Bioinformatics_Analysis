# Garrett Lam's Portfoilio
This repository contains my portfolio of personal / group projects completed for academic, professional, and self-learning purposes.

## Bioinformatics
- [scRNAseqFilterQC](https://github.com/garrett-lam/scRNAseq_filterQC) [[Project Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XgOW-6e421SOSL-6hSqZFMLKK-e-w1ON/view?usp=sharing): Python command-line tool to streamline the process of quality control filtering of scRNA-seq data in Scanpy

- [Immunophenotyping scRNA-seq data](https://github.com/garrett-lam/garrett-lam.github.io/blob/main/hollern_lab/scRNA_immunophenotyping.md): Analyzed scRNA-seq CD40-treated & non-treated Triple-Negative Breast Cancer *mus musculus* models in Seurat

## Data Science / Machine Learning

- [Epileptic Seizure Prediction: Exploring Machine Learning Models with Electroencephalogram Data](https://github.com/garrett-lam/garrett-lam.github.io/blob/main/ds3/epileptic_seizure_prediction.ipynb) [[Project Paper]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z0yGWbZPRzeD8ya7fw3oiiN10p57gkzswT-5CzGyN3A/edit?usp=sharing): Developed classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayesian, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees) to identify the optimal model for accurately predicting epileptic seizures from EEG data 

- [Diabetes Risk Factors in Pima Indian Population](https://github.com/garrett-lam/garrett-lam.github.io/blob/main/cogs/diabetes_risk_factors.ipynb): Utilized OLS Regression and KNNs to determine health factors that create a higher risk for diabetes within the female Pima Indian Population
