# Garrett Lam's Portfolio
This repository contains my portfolio of personal / group projects completed for academic, professional, and self-learning purposes.

## Bioinformatics
- [scRNAseqFilterQC](https://github.com/garrett-lam/scRNAseq_filterQC) [[Project Report]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XgOW-6e421SOSL-6hSqZFMLKK-e-w1ON/view?usp=sharing): Python command-line tool to streamline the process of quality control filtering of scRNA-seq data in Scanpy

- [Immunophenotyping scRNA-seq data](https://github.com/garrett-lam/garrett-lam.github.io/blob/main/hollern_lab/scRNA_immunophenotyping.md): Analyzed scRNA-seq CD40-treated & non-treated Triple-Negative Breast Cancer *mus musculus* models in Seurat

- [Methods for Differential Gene Expression Analysis](https://github.com/garrett-lam/garrett-lam.github.io/blob/main/beng/differential_gene_expression.md): Compared and contrasted various methods of differential gene expression analysis (CuffDiff, edgeR, DESeq2)

## Data Science / Machine Learning
