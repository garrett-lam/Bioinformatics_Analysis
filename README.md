# Garrett Lam's Portfoilio
This repository contains my portfolio of bioinformatics projects completed for academic, professional, and self-learning purposes.

## Bioinformatics

- [Immunophenotyping scRNA-seq data using Seurat](https://github.com/garrett-lam/garrett-lam.github.io/blob/main/hollern_lab/scRNA_immunophenotyping.md): Analyzed scRNA-seq CD40-treated & non-treated Triple-Negative Breast Cancer *mus musculus* models

## Data Science / Machine Learning

- [Epileptic Seizure Prediction: Exploring Machine Learning Models with Electroencephalogram (EEG) Data](): Developed classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayesian, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees) to identify the optimal model for accurately predicting epileptic seizures from EEG data [[Research Paper]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z0yGWbZPRzeD8ya7fw3oiiN10p57gkzswT-5CzGyN3A/edit?usp=sharing)

- [Diabetes Risk Factors in Pima Indian Population](https://github.com/garrett-lam/garrett-lam.github.io/blob/main/cogs/diabetes_risk_factors.ipynb): Utilized OLS Regression and KNNs to determine health factors that create a higher risk for diabetes within the female Pima Indian Population
